oauth2-passport-angular
=======================

A simple demo project for showing OAuth2 authentication flows between third party providers using passport.

This was designed to demonstrate how to use passport to authenticate with a third party provider thereby gaining a token. This token could then be sent to a client application (in my case, an AngularJS frontend) to query a REST based API server.
